**Reporting a Vulnerability
**

"Gravitee consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present.
If you discover a serious vulnerability with a realistic and tested risk assessment we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.
We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems and submit:
Critical risk vulnerabilities which could result in non-trivial data loss for Gravitee or our customers:
Bugs which could lead to sensitive massive/complete data leakage
Bugs leading to remote code execution

Bugs which can lead to private keys leakage or other cryptographic flaws

High risk vulnerabilities that we would consider to be High risk would include:
Permanent subdomain takeover

XSS or CSRF resulting in significant security or privacy impact to customers
Ability to view, modify, or delete sensitive data in misconfigured on data repository
Authentication/Authorisation issues that allow bypass the security settings
Security misconfigurations that result in data leakage or system compromise
Bugs allowing unauthorised operations on user accounts, with a low amount of effort required to attack/compromise a large number users
Website, blogs or forums with relevant discussions on how to abuse Gravitee systems
Only after review, assessment and confirmation by the Gravitee Information Security Team a risk critical score will be determined.

Low - 0.1 - 3.9
